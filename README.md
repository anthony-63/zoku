# zoku!
A rhythm game inspired by the nintendo DS game "Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan"

### zoku?
Since "Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan" is about cheering and battling I came up with zoku which means family or tribe.

### Goals behind this project
It may seem stupid that im just writing another open source osu! client but I plan to optimize, and make this a super customizable client. I want to support osu!game charts and a custom map format.
